# End-User Documentation Guidelines

When working with files in the docs folder, focus on creating user-friendly documentation that helps end users understand and use the application effectively.

## Purpose

Write clear, accessible user guides that help end users:

- Understand what the application does and its key capabilities
- Learn how to use features
- Troubleshoot common issues

## Target Audience

- End users with no technical background
- Streamers and content creators
- People who want to use the application's features without understanding the code

## Writing Style

- **Simple Language**: Use plain, non-technical language that anyone can understand
- **User-Focused**: Frame everything from the user's perspective ("You can..." instead of "The system...")
- **Authentic Tone**: Avoid corporate buzzwords, marketing jargon, and fishy catchphrases - write naturally and conversationally
- Be direct and clear. Users should be able to quickly parse the information and find what they want.

## Visual Formatting & Layout

Create visually appealing documentation that's easy to scan and read:

- **Break Up Text**: Avoid long walls of text - use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- **Use Headers Effectively**: Structure content with clear H2, H3, H4 headings for easy navigation
- **Lists & Bullets**: Use numbered lists for steps, bullet points for features/benefits
- **Emphasis**: Use **bold** for important terms, _italics_ for UI elements or emphasis
- **Code Blocks**: Format any technical terms, settings, or examples in `code blocks`
- **Callout Boxes**: Use blockquotes (>) for important tips, warnings, or key information
- **Custom Containers**: Use custom container syntax for enhanced visual impact when context requires it:
  - `::: info Title` - General information and explanations
  - `::: tip Title` - Helpful suggestions and best practices
  - `::: warning Title` - Important cautions and potential issues
  - `::: danger Title` - Critical warnings and serious risks
  - `::: details Title` - Expandable sections with additional details
- **Emojis**: Use sparingly and appropriately to add personality (🎯 for goals, ⚠️ for warnings, 💡 for tips, ✅ for completed steps)
- **Tables**: Use tables for comparing options or listing settings
- **Divider Lines**: Don't add divider lines between headers (`---`), our theme handles this automatically

## Documentation Focus Areas

- Application capabilities and what users can achieve
- User interface walkthroughs
- Configuration options that matter to end users
- Integration setup from user perspective
- Creative ways to use features
