## 🔐 Authenticity Verification

The code running on [pointauc.com](https://pointauc.com) can be verified against this repository. Each deployment generates SHA-256 hashes of all HTML, JS, and CSS files, published as an immutable [GitHub release](https://github.com/Pointauc/pointauc_frontend/releases) with the tag format `deploy-<commit-sha>`.

### Verify Deployed Files

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Pointauc/pointauc_frontend.git
cd pointauc_frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Verify the deployed files
pnpm verify:authenticity
```

This script downloads the hash manifest from the latest release, fetches each file from the live site, compares hashes, and shows which files match or differ

### Why This Matters

- **Transparency**: Anyone can independently verify that the deployed website matches the source code
- **Security**: Even if our server is compromised, you can detect unauthorized modifications

### Important Note

Pointeauc uses claudflare which may inject a script into the HTML files. The Cloudflare script provides DDoS protection and bot mitigation and doesn't affect the website functionality.

If you want to verify the integrity of HTML files manually, you need to strip the claudflare script tag. This process is done AUTOMATICALLY by the verification script.
