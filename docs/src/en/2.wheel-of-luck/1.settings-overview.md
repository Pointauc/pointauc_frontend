# Settings Overview

The Wheel of Luck provides various configuration options to customize the spinning experience.

> **💾 Auto-Save:** All settings are automatically saved and persist across sessions, ensuring your preferred configuration is maintained. However not all settings are bound to your account, so you may lose some of your settings if you clear your browser cache/cookies.

Here's an overview of all available settings:

## Spin Timing

### `Fixed Spin Duration`

Set the exact spin time in seconds

### `Random Spin`

Random spin toggle is located on the right side of the fixed spin duration input.

You can specify `min` and `max` values for the random spin duration. The actual spin duration will be a random value between the `min` and `max` values.

## `Wheel Format`

Choose from three different wheel modes:

- [**Normal**](./2.formats/1.normal.md): Standard single wheel spin with all participants
- [**Dropout**](./2.formats/2.dropout.md): Elimination-style wheel where participants are removed after each spin
- [**Battle Royal**](./2.formats/3.battle-royal.md): Wheel participants are split into pairs and the loser of each pair is eliminated after each spin

## Additional Features

### `Split Control`

You can split big participants into smaller segments. These segments will be distributed evenly across the wheel. You can use it to make the wheel more exciting and less predictable.

It doesn't affect the chance of winning and is only a visual effect.

### `Random.org Integration`

An alternative option for winner generation using Random.org's true random number service.

In practice, this method doesn't really provide any benefits over the default approach, but it's available for users who want to use it.

### `Core Image`

Image that will be displayed in the center of the wheel.

- 🌐 You can upload an image from your computer or use an image URL from the internet.
- 🎨 You can use one of the default images.
- ![7tv-logo](/7tv-logo.png){ width="20" height="20" style="float: left; margin-right: 8px; position: relative; top: 2px;" } You can connect your `twitch` channel and use your `7tv` emotes.

### `Participants Import` {#lots-import}

Import participant lists from external text files to quickly populate the wheel with your own data.

**Supported Format:**

- plain text file format (similar to `csv`, but extension doesn't matter)
- you can specify `name` and `amount` for each participant
- `amount` is optional and defaults to `1`

::: code-group

```csv [example.csv]
John Doe,10
Jane Smith,5
John Aukoff
```

**How to Import:**

1. Click the import button to open the file dialog
2. Drag & drop a text file or click to browse and select
3. Choose whether to add participants to the auction or just the wheel
4. Confirm the import

> **ℹ️ Additional Notes:**
>
> - Only one file can be imported at a time
> - Imported participants will appear in the wheel immediately
> - By default, new participants **won't affect the main auction** - they're only added to the wheel
