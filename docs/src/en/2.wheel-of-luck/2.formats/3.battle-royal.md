# Battle Royal 🏆

The Battle Royal format transforms your wheel into an exciting tournament where participants face off against each other in head-to-head battles. Think of it as a knockout tournament where only the strongest survive!

## How It Works

When you select Battle Royal format, the application automatically creates a tournament bracket for all your participants. Here's what happens:

### Tournament Structure

- **Bracket Generation**: All participants are organized into a tournament bracket
- **Head-to-Head Battles**: Each spin features only 2 participants with similar point amounts
- **Winner Takes All**: The victor claims all points from their opponent
- **Advancement**: Winners move to the next round, losers are eliminated
- **Final Showdown**: The last two standing face off with roughly equal points

### Point Distribution

The tournament is designed so that the final round features two participants who each hold approximately **half of the total auction points**. This creates an intense, balanced finale where both finalists have equal chances of victory.

## Fair Play Guarantee

Despite the tournament format, Battle Royal maintains the same mathematical fairness as the normal wheel.

::: details Mathematical Proof
**Theorem**: In Battle Royal format, each participant's probability of winning the tournament equals their points divided by total points.

**Given**:

- Participants have points p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ
- Total points P = p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₙ
- In each battle between participants i and j, P(i wins) = pᵢ/(pᵢ + pⱼ)

**To Prove**: P(participant i wins tournament) = pᵢ/P

**Proof by Mathematical Induction**:

_Base Case (n = 2)_:
With 2 participants having points p₁ and p₂:

```
P(participant 1 wins) = p₁/(p₁ + p₂) = p₁/P ✓
```

_Inductive Step_:
Assume theorem holds for k participants. Consider k+1 participants.

For participant i with points pᵢ who battles participant j with points pⱼ:

1. **Survival Probability**: P(i survives battle) = pᵢ/(pᵢ + pⱼ)

2. **Points After Victory**: i gains j's points → total points = pᵢ + pⱼ

3. **Remaining Tournament**: By inductive hypothesis, P(i wins remaining) = (pᵢ + pⱼ)/P

4. **Total Probability**:

```
P(i wins tournament) = P(i survives) × P(i wins remaining)
                    = [pᵢ/(pᵢ + pⱼ)] × [(pᵢ + pⱼ)/P]
                    = pᵢ/P ✓
```

**Key Insight**: Point conservation and proportional battle outcomes ensure that initial point ratios determine final winning probabilities, regardless of tournament bracket structure.

**Example**:

- Alice: 300 points (30%)
- Bob: 500 points (50%)
- Charlie: 200 points (20%)
- Total: 1000 points

No matter how the tournament unfolds, Alice always has exactly 30% chance of winning, Bob has 50%, and Charlie has 20%.

## Settings

### `Grouping`

The Battle Royal format includes a special **Grouping** setting that lets you control the pace of your tournament:

#### Default: Duels (1v1)

- Each round features exactly 2 participants
- Best for smaller participant pools

#### Multi-Participant Groups

- Adjust the grouping slider to include more participants per round
- Speeds up tournaments with many participants
- Still maintains competitive balance

> 💡 **Tip**: If you have 100+ participants, consider increasing the grouping to 3-4 participants to keep your stream moving at a good pace.

## When to Use Battle Royal

**Perfect for:**

- Gaming streams with competitive themes
- Longer streams where you can build tension over time
- **Underdog Stories**: Watch smaller participants defeat larger ones
