# Normal Format

The **Normal** format is the most straightforward and commonly used wheel format. It's selected by default.

## How It Works

- Each participant gets a **wheel segment** that's proportional to their point contribution
- The wheel is **spun only once** to determine the winner
- The winner is selected based on **weighted probability** - more points = better chances

## Key Benefits

✅ **Easy to Understand** - Easy concept that viewers can quickly grasp and see how their points translate to winning chances

✅ **Quick and Simple** - One spin determines the winner

## Example Scenario

> **Streamer Giveaway**: You're giving away a game key
>
> - Alice contributed 500 points → Gets ~50% of the wheel
> - Bob contributed 300 points → Gets ~30% of the wheel
> - Charlie contributed 200 points → Gets ~20% of the wheel
>
> When you spin, Alice has the best chance but Bob and Charlie still have meaningful opportunities to win!
