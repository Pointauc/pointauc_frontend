# Dropout Wheel Format

The **Dropout Wheel** is an exciting elimination-style wheel format that creates maximum suspense by gradually removing participants until only one winner remains. It's perfect for building tension and keeping your audience engaged throughout the entire process!

## üéØ How Dropout Wheels Work

Unlike a regular wheel where you spin once to find a winner, the dropout wheel works through **elimination rounds**:

1. **First Spin**: One participant gets eliminated and removed from the wheel
2. **Continue Spinning**: Keep spinning until participants are eliminated one by one
3. **Final Winner**: The last remaining participant wins the auction

## ‚öñÔ∏è Fair Chances Guaranteed

The dropout format maintains the same probability distribution as a normal wheel:

- **Higher contributors** still have proportionally better chances to win
- **Mathematical algorithms** ensure the elimination process doesn't affect final odds
- This format is **equal** to the [normal wheel](./1.normal.md) in terms of chances

## Dropout Subtypes

There are two different types of dropout wheels. Both are mathematically equal, but looks a bit different:

### Simulated (Modern) Dropout **‚Üê Recommended** {#simulated}

**How it works:**

- The **final winner is determined before the first spin** using fair probability
- The app then **generates an elimination sequence** to build suspense
- Wheel segments are sized purely for **visual effect and tension**

**Why choose this:**

- ‚úÖ **Guaranteed drama** - algorithm ensures exciting eliminations
- ‚úÖ **Consistent experience** - every dropout feels engaging
- ‚úÖ **Viewer-friendly** - segment sizes make visual sense
- ‚úÖ **Mathematically perfect** - winner selection is purely based on contribution odds

**Best for:** Most streamers who want reliable, engaging content

### Classic Dropout {#classic}

**How it works:**

- Each spin uses **real-time probability calculations**
- Winner (person eliminated) is **truly randomized** on every spin
- Segment sizes reflect **actual elimination chances** for that specific round
- You can read full **math explanation** behind this in [this article](https://pointauc.com/assets/dropout_proof-60226c52.pdf)

**Why choose this:**

- ‚úÖ **Pure randomness** - every spin is genuinely unpredictable
- ‚úÖ **Mathematical authenticity** - segments show real probabilities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Complex visuals** - segment sizes may confuse viewers without math background
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Final round predictability** - some eliminations might feel anticlimactic

**Best for:** Streamers who prefer genuine randomness and have audiences interested in the mathematical aspect

## ü§î Which Should You Choose?

#### Choose **Simulated** if you want:

- Consistent, dramatic elimination sequences
- Easy-to-understand visual segments
- **This is our recommendation for most users**

#### Choose **Classic** if you want:

- Complete mathematical transparency
- True randomness on every single spin
- Don't mind explaining the complex probability calculations to viewers

## üí° Pro Tips for Dropout Wheels

::: tip Best Practices

- **Explain the format** to your audience before starting
- Set a small spin time at the beginning, but make it longer for the final rounds
- **Reassure participants** that their chances remain fair despite the elimination format
