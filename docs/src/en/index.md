> **Let your viewers decide what happens on your stream**

Pointauc is a web tool that organizes viewer input for streamers. Instead of asking "what should I play next?" and getting flooded with chat messages, viewers can place bids using channel points or donations.

You get a clear list of what people want, and can pick winners using different selection methods. It encourages viewer engagement and activity on stream.

> 💡 **Not just for streaming** - Use Pointauc for any kind of lottery, contest, or group decision-making where you need to collect entries and pick winners fairly.

## 🎮 What does it do?

Your viewers can bid on:

> 🎲 **What game you play next**  
> 🎬 **Which movie/video to watch**  
> ⭐ **Any custom option you create**

You get the bids organized in a clean interface, and can pick winners using different methods like wheels, battles, or simple highest bidder.
