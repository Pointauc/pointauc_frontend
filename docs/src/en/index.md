# Introduction to Pointauc

> **Let your viewers decide what happens on your stream**

Pointauc helps you organize viewer input. Instead of trying to read every "play this!" message in chat, you can let your viewers place official bids using channel points or donations.

You get a clean, organized list of requests and can pick winners fairly using fun selection methods. It's the perfect way to boost engagement and give your community a real voice in your content.

::: tip 💡 Not just for streaming
While built for streamers, Pointauc works great for **any** group decision-making. Use it for lotteries, contests, or community polls where you need to collect entries and pick winners transparently.

## What can you do?

Give your viewers control over:

> 🎲 **What game you play next**  
> 🎬 **Which movie/video to watch**  
> ⭐ **Any custom option you create**

You manage everything from a simple dashboard, picking winners via **Spin Wheels** or **Highest Bidder**.

## How viewers participate
