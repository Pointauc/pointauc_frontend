2. Toggle each section using the checkboxes:
   - ☑️ **Show Rules**
   - ☑️ **Show Table**
   - ☑️ **Show Timer**
3. Your overlay updates instantly

### Background Transparency

Control how see-through your overlay background is:

- **0% (Solid)**: Completely opaque background
- **50% (Semi-transparent)**: Partially see-through
- **100% (Transparent)**: Completely transparent background

### Table Settings

Fine-tune how the auction table behaves on stream:
