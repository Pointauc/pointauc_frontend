# Overlays Overview

## What are overlays?

Overlays are clean, transparent web pages that mirror your auction or wheel in real time. Drop them into your streaming software so viewers see the action without the need to keep your browser open.

## Why they help

- **Seamless for viewers**: Bids and wheel spins appear instantly on stream.
- **Clean look**: Transparent background blends into your layout.
- **Flexible**: Show only what you want and match your style.

## How it works

You control everything on your main page. The overlay simply mirrors it. If a bid comes in or the wheel spins, your audience sees it immediately—no extra clicks needed.

## Quick setup in OBS

Do these steps only once.

1. In your auction or wheel page, click the **Overlay** button and copy the link.
2. In OBS, add a **Browser** source and paste the link.
3. Match your canvas size, then click OK.

| Setting                                     | Value                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `URL`                                       | Your overlay link              |
| `Width`                                     | `1920` (or your stream width)  |
| `Height`                                    | `1080` (or your stream height) |
| `FPS`                                       | `30`                           |
| `CSS`                                       | Leave as it is                 |
| `Shutdown source when not visible`          | ✅                             |
| `Refresh browser when scene becomes active` | ✅                             |

Once added, position the overlay like any other source. The background is transparent, so only the auction/wheel elements will be visible on top of your scene.
