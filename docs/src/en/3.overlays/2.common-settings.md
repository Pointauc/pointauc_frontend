# Common settings

These options appear for every overlay type. Adjust them first before fine‑tuning type‑specific settings.

## `Name`

- A short label to identify the overlay in your list.
- This is also shown on the edit page header.

## `Canvas resolution`

- Sets the overlay canvas size (e.g., `1920x1080`).
- Match this to your streaming canvas to avoid scaling in OBS.
- You can change it anytime; the overlay will reflow to the new size.

> Tip: If you stream at 1080p, pick `1920x1080`. For 720p, pick `1280x720`.

## Type‑specific settings next

- See [Overlay types](./overlay-types/) for options like `Show table`, `Show timer`, `Show wheel`, and more.
- For moving and resizing the entire overlay on the canvas, read [Overlay positioning](./4.overlay-positioning.md).
