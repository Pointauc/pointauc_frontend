# Overlay positioning

You will be able to move and resize the entire overlay within its `Canvas resolution`.

## How it will work

- Drag the overlay body to change its position.
- Drag the red border handles to resize.
- The aspect ratio is free unless constrained in the future by settings.

::: info Why this matters
Positioning lets you fit the overlay into complex scenes without editing layouts on the main page. It saves time when switching scenes.

## Status

✅ **Available** - This feature is now implemented and ready to use!

## Usage

1. **Moving the overlay**: Click and drag anywhere inside the overlay to change its position
2. **Resizing width**: Drag the left or right borders to adjust the width
3. **Resizing height**: Drag the top or bottom borders to adjust the height
4. **Resizing both dimensions**: Drag the red corner handle in the bottom-right to resize both width and height simultaneously
5. **Snap to guides**: The overlay will automatically snap to container edges and center lines when dragged close to them

## Visual Indicators

- **Red border**: Shows the overlay boundaries and indicates it's selected for positioning
- **Red corner square**: Located in bottom-right corner for diagonal resizing
- **Green guidelines**: Appear when snapping to help with precise alignment
