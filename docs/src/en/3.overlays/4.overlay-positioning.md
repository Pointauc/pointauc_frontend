# Overlay positioning

You will be able to move and resize the entire overlay within its `Canvas resolution`.

## How it will work

- Drag the overlay body to change its position.
- Drag the red border handles to resize.
- The aspect ratio is free unless constrained in the future by settings.

::: info Why this matters
Positioning lets you fit the overlay into complex scenes without editing layouts on the main page. It saves time when switching scenes.

## Status

This feature is planned and not yet available. We’ll update this page once it ships.

> In the meantime, you can position the Browser Source directly in OBS as usual.
