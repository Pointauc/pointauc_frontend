# Wheel Overlay

The wheel overlay replicates your main `wheel` page with a transparent background.

## What You'll See

:::info 🎡 Wheel Section
Shows the spinning wheel. It uses the same wheel settings and will start moving when you click the spin button on the main website. The result of the spin would also be the same.
:::

:::info 👥 Participants Section
Shows everyone who's currently part of the wheel. If dropout wheel selected, this section will be updated automatically after the spin.
