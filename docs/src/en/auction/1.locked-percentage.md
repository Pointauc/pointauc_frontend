# Locked Percentage Lots

The Locked Percentage feature allows you to fix a lot's value to a specific percentage of the total auction amount. When other lots change, locked lots automatically recalculate to maintain their percentage.

## How It Works

When you lock a lot to a percentage (e.g., 25%), that lot will always represent exactly 25% of the total auction value, regardless of changes to other lots.

### Example

Imagine you have three lots:
- Lot A: 100 points (unlocked)
- Lot B: 50 points (unlocked)
- Lot C: Locked to 25%

Total of unlocked lots: 150 points
Lot C will automatically be: 150 × (25 / (100 - 25)) = 50 points
Total auction value: 200 points (Lot C is exactly 25%)

If someone adds 50 points to Lot A:
- Lot A: 150 points (unlocked)
- Lot B: 50 points (unlocked)
- Lot C: Automatically recalculates to 66.67 points (still 25% of total)

## How to Lock a Lot

1. Enable "Show Winning Chances" in auction settings if not already enabled
2. Click on the percentage value next to any lot
3. A popover will appear with:
   - Percentage input field
   - Lock/Unlock toggle button
   - Apply button

4. Enter the desired percentage (0-100)
5. Click the lock icon to enable locking
6. Click "Apply" to save

## Visual Indicators

Locked lots are visually distinct:
- **Yellow/gold percentage text** with a lock icon
- **Highlighted background** with a gold left border
- **Tooltip** showing the locked percentage when hovering

## Multiple Locked Lots

You can lock multiple lots simultaneously. All locked lots will recalculate together when other lots change.

:::warning Important Limitation
The total sum of all locked percentages cannot exceed 100%. If you try to lock a lot that would cause the total to reach or exceed 100%, the lock button will be disabled with a tooltip explaining why.

## Unlocking a Lot

To unlock a lot:
1. Click on its percentage value
2. Click the lock icon to toggle it off
3. Click "Apply"

Alternatively, manually editing a locked lot's amount will automatically unlock it.

## Use Cases

### Equal Distribution
Lock multiple lots to the same percentage to ensure equal distribution regardless of bid amounts.

### Guaranteed Minimum
Lock a "consolation prize" lot to 10% to ensure it always has value.

### Tournament Brackets
Lock winner/runner-up lots to specific percentages (e.g., 60% and 30%) for consistent prize distribution.

### Dynamic Prize Pools
As donations come in, locked lots automatically scale with the growing total.

## Technical Details

**Formula for locked lot calculation:**
```
lockedLot.amount = totalOfUnlockedLots × (lockedPercentage / (100 - totalLockedPercentage))
```

**Automatic recalculation triggers:**
- When any unlocked lot amount changes
- When donations/bids are added to unlocked lots
- When lots are deleted or created

**Manual edits unlock:**
- Manually changing a locked lot's amount unlocks it
- Adding extra amount to a locked lot unlocks it
- This prevents conflicts between manual and automatic values
